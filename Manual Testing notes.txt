Manual Testing

Module 1: Software Testing concepts 

Software Testing : 

System S/W : 

e.g - Operating system , Drivers 

Programming Software: 

e.g -  Compilers , Interpreters , debugging tools etc ..

Application Software : 

Web apps , Stand alone apps , mobile apps , Silver lite , Mainframe apps , etc ...


Testing : 


The process of checking developed software is working as per client Business requirements or not .

-> finding defects 
-> quality 

prime motto of testing is to provide 

a quality and risk free product ..


What do we test in now-a-days ?

-> Functionalities
-> GUI 
-> Usability 
-> Performance 
-> Load 
-> Security 
-> compatablity etc ...

how do we test ?

Manual Testing : 

If any test activity carried out using Man effort then it is called Manual Testing

Automation Testing:

If any test activity carried out using a tool /program/script then it is called Automation Testing


Software Testing terminologies :

1. Product

if a software application developed for multilple customer then it is called Product

e.g NCR --> ATM machine and Software

e.g Fidelity --> Banking product 

2. Project 

if a software application developed for single customer then it is called Project

--> for HDFC only

TCS --> using Fidelity product for Bank of America 

Error : 

Defect / Bug : 

Fault/Failure/Incident: 

Module 2: Software Testing Project

Module 3: Agile Methodlogy and JIRA tool 

Module 4: SQL or Database Testing



==============================================================================
S/W Testing is nothing but 

checking are we developing right software or not  and also 
checking developed software is working as per client Business requirements or not .


S/W Testing = Verification + Validation

Verification nothing but reviewing some kind of documents 

Validation is nothing testing the code 


======================================================
Roles/Duties of Tester :

1) Understanding the AUT (Application under Test) / Domain Knowledge 
2) Formal Testing (Writing and executing test cases)
3) Adhoc Testing or Informal Testing (No Test cases)
4) Finding defects & reporting to developer 
5) ReTesting and Regression Testing 
6) Develop Test scripts 
7) Executing the test scripts 
8) Analyse the results 
9) Prepare TEst reports 

=============================================================

Software Testing Principles : 
1) Exhaustive testing is impossible
2) Defect Clustering
3) Pesticide Paradox 
4) Early Testing 
5) Testing is application dependent / sometimes situation dependent
6) Testing should show presence of defects
7) Absence of defects is fallacy

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)



						SDLC Models 
						
						
		1) Sequential 	Models				2) Iterative or Incremental Models				
						
1) Sequential 	Models
   - Waterfall Model 
   - V Model 
   

Waterfall Model : 

- small projects
- Requirements Clear
- Each Phase is freezed once completed

V Model :

- small projects

- when Requirements are not Clear

2) Iterative or Incremental Models	

- RAD Model (Rapid Application Development)
		--> Big Projects
		--> to be completed fastly
		
- Prototype Model 
		--> Big Projects 
		--> when customer doen't have requirements clear and refer to some already existing app 
		
- Spiral Model
		--> Big Projects
		--> Requirements is dependent on other requirements

- Agile Model
