Manual Testing

Module 1: Software Testing concepts 

Software Testing : 

System S/W : 

e.g - Operating system , Drivers 

Programming Software: 

e.g -  Compilers , Interpreters , debugging tools etc ..

Application Software : 

Web apps , Stand alone apps , mobile apps , Silver lite , Mainframe apps , etc ...


Testing : 


The process of checking developed software is working as per client Business requirements or not .

-> finding defects 
-> quality 

prime motto of testing is to provide 

a quality and risk free product ..


What do we test in now-a-days ?

-> Functionalities
-> GUI 
-> Usability 
-> Performance 
-> Load 
-> Security 
-> compatablity etc ...

how do we test ?

Manual Testing : 

If any test activity carried out using Man effort then it is called Manual Testing

Automation Testing:

If any test activity carried out using a tool /program/script then it is called Automation Testing


Software Testing terminologies :

1. Product

if a software application developed for multilple customer then it is called Product

e.g NCR --> ATM machine and Software

e.g Fidelity --> Banking product 

2. Project 

if a software application developed for single customer then it is called Project

--> for HDFC only

TCS --> using Fidelity product for Bank of America 

Error : 

Defect / Bug : 

Fault/Failure/Incident: 

Module 2: Software Testing Project

Module 3: Agile Methodlogy and JIRA tool 

Module 4: SQL or Database Testing



==============================================================================
S/W Testing is nothing but 

checking are we developing right software or not  and also 
checking developed software is working as per client Business requirements or not .


S/W Testing = Verification + Validation

Verification nothing but reviewing some kind of documents 

Validation is nothing testing the code 


======================================================
Roles/Duties of Tester :

1) Understanding the AUT (Application under Test) / Domain Knowledge 
2) Formal Testing (Writing and executing test cases)
3) Adhoc Testing or Informal Testing (No Test cases)
4) Finding defects & reporting to developer 
5) ReTesting and Regression Testing 
6) Develop Test scripts 
7) Executing the test scripts 
8) Analyse the results 
9) Prepare TEst reports 

=============================================================

Software Testing Principles : 
1) Exhaustive testing is impossible
2) Defect Clustering
3) Pesticide Paradox 
4) Early Testing 
5) Testing is application dependent / sometimes situation dependent
6) Testing should show presence of defects
7) Absence of defects is fallacy 


======================================================

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)



						SDLC Models 
						
						
		1) Sequential 	Models				2) Iterative or Incremental Models				
						
1) Sequential 	Models
   - Waterfall Model 
   - V Model 
   

Waterfall Model : 

- small projects
- Requirements Clear
- Each Phase is freezed once completed

V Model :

- small projects

- when Requirements are not Clear

2) Iterative or Incremental Models	

- RAD Model (Rapid Application Development)
		--> Big Projects
		--> to be completed fastly
		
- Prototype Model 
		--> Big Projects 
		--> when customer doen't have requirements clear and refer to some already existing app 
		
- Spiral Model
		--> Big Projects
		--> Requirements is dependent on other requirements

- Agile Model 		


Software Testing Approaches :

						Static Testing						Dynamic Testing
						
						
Review : Examing a project related task 

Types of Reviews :

1) Requirment reviews :  domain experts / SME (Subject  Matter Experts)

BRS (Buisness Requirment Specifictaions)
BRD (Buisness Requirment Document)

2) Design Review :  Technical Experts (Solution Architects or System  Architects) 

3) Code Reviews : Senior Developers 
Coding standards 

4) Test case Reviews : Test Lead 

Formal Review : If any review activity carried out by following proper review procedures 


Inspection : If a formal review carried out while execution of task .


Audit :  If a formal review carried out after execution of task .

Peer Reviews : by team members 

Walk Throughs : Knowledge Transfers 

e.g : MTP (Master Test Plan ) Walkthrough 
or  Test Strategy 

--------------------------
dynamc Testing :

1) Unit Testing : 
Smallest part of source code like method , function , procedure  are called units .


2) Integration Testing : 

once all units are tested , programmer will combine all units and test his code . 

3) White BOx testing : (done by developers)

Unit Testing + Integration Testing 

4) System Testing : (Done by testers)

Once Integration Testing completed , developer will compiled the soucre code into an executable code (Build) 

for , URL /  .apk  / .ipa / .exe 

5) User Acceptance Testing (UAT) : (Done by Testers/ Client / some 33rd party Testing companies)

6) Black Box Testing :

System Testing + User Acceptance Testing (UAT) 

UAT (User Acceptance Testing) :

Testing carried out by the end user on the delivered product to make sure 
whether it is ready for live production or not .

Two stages :

1. Alpha Testing 

It is a first level of Acceptance testing carried out at company premises

2. Beta Testing 

It is a last level of Acceptance testing carried out at customer/client premises

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functional System Testing Types:

1) Smoke Testing 
2) Formal Testing 
3) ReTesting
4) Regression Testing 
5) Priority based testing 
6) Sanity Testing 
7) End-to-End 
8) Ahdoc TEsting 

Special Functional System Testing :

1)Benchmark Testing 
2) Exploratory Testing 
3) Monkey Testing or Gorilla Testing 

Non-Functional System Testing Types:

1) UI TEsting or GUI Testing 
2) Usability Testing or User Friendliness 
3) Performance Testing 

Responsiveness
Stability

i) reposnse time
ii) processing time
iii) concurrent user volume 

Load Testing :

-> Stress Testing 
-> Soak Testing
-> Spike Testing
-> Volume TEsting 

4) Globalization or Internationalization or I18N Testing 

5)Localization or L10N testing 

6)Compatability 

7)Recovery Testing 

8)Installation Testing 

9)UnInstallation Testing
