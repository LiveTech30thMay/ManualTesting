Manual Testing

Module 1: Software Testing concepts 

Software Testing : 

System S/W : 

e.g - Operating system , Drivers 

Programming Software: 

e.g -  Compilers , Interpreters , debugging tools etc ..

Application Software : 

Web apps , Stand alone apps , mobile apps , Silver lite , Mainframe apps , etc ...


Testing : 


The process of checking developed software is working as per client Business requirements or not .

-> finding defects 
-> quality 

prime motto of testing is to provide 

a quality and risk free product ..


What do we test in now-a-days ?

-> Functionalities
-> GUI 
-> Usability 
-> Performance 
-> Load 
-> Security 
-> compatablity etc ...

how do we test ?

Manual Testing : 

If any test activity carried out using Man effort then it is called Manual Testing

Automation Testing:

If any test activity carried out using a tool /program/script then it is called Automation Testing


Software Testing terminologies :

1. Product

if a software application developed for multilple customer then it is called Product

e.g NCR --> ATM machine and Software

e.g Fidelity --> Banking product 

2. Project 

if a software application developed for single customer then it is called Project

--> for HDFC only

TCS --> using Fidelity product for Bank of America 

Error : 

Defect / Bug : 

Fault/Failure/Incident: 

Module 2: Software Testing Project

Module 3: Agile Methodlogy and JIRA tool 

Module 4: SQL or Database Testing



==============================================================================
S/W Testing is nothing but 

checking are we developing right software or not  and also 
checking developed software is working as per client Business requirements or not .


S/W Testing = Verification + Validation

Verification nothing but reviewing some kind of documents 

Validation is nothing testing the code 


======================================================
Roles/Duties of Tester :

1) Understanding the AUT (Application under Test) / Domain Knowledge 
2) Formal Testing (Writing and executing test cases)
3) Adhoc Testing or Informal Testing (No Test cases)
4) Finding defects & reporting to developer 
5) ReTesting and Regression Testing 
6) Develop Test scripts 
7) Executing the test scripts 
8) Analyse the results 
9) Prepare TEst reports 

=============================================================

Software Testing Principles : 
1) Exhaustive testing is impossible
2) Defect Clustering
3) Pesticide Paradox 
4) Early Testing 
5) Testing is application dependent / sometimes situation dependent
6) Testing should show presence of defects
7) Absence of defects is fallacy 


======================================================

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)



						SDLC Models 
						
						
		1) Sequential 	Models				2) Iterative or Incremental Models				
						
1) Sequential 	Models
   - Waterfall Model 
   - V Model 
   

Waterfall Model : 

- small projects
- Requirements Clear
- Each Phase is freezed once completed

V Model :

- small projects

- when Requirements are not Clear

2) Iterative or Incremental Models	

- RAD Model (Rapid Application Development)
		--> Big Projects
		--> to be completed fastly
		
- Prototype Model 
		--> Big Projects 
		--> when customer doen't have requirements clear and refer to some already existing app 
		
- Spiral Model
		--> Big Projects
		--> Requirements is dependent on other requirements

- Agile Model 		


Software Testing Approaches :

						Static Testing						Dynamic Testing
						
						
Review : Examing a project related task 

Types of Reviews :

1) Requirment reviews :  domain experts / SME (Subject  Matter Experts)

BRS (Buisness Requirment Specifictaions)
BRD (Buisness Requirment Document)

2) Design Review :  Technical Experts (Solution Architects or System  Architects) 

3) Code Reviews : Senior Developers 
Coding standards 

4) Test case Reviews : Test Lead 

Formal Review : If any review activity carried out by following proper review procedures 


Inspection : If a formal review carried out while execution of task .


Audit :  If a formal review carried out after execution of task .

Peer Reviews : by team members 

Walk Throughs : Knowledge Transfers 

e.g : MTP (Master Test Plan ) Walkthrough 
or  Test Strategy 

--------------------------
dynamc Testing :

1) Unit Testing : 
Smallest part of source code like method , function , procedure  are called units .


2) Integration Testing : 

once all units are tested , programmer will combine all units and test his code . 

3) White BOx testing : (done by developers)

Unit Testing + Integration Testing 

4) System Testing : (Done by testers)

Once Integration Testing completed , developer will compiled the soucre code into an executable code (Build) 

for , URL /  .apk  / .ipa / .exe 

5) User Acceptance Testing (UAT) : (Done by Testers/ Client / some 33rd party Testing companies)

6) Black Box Testing :

System Testing + User Acceptance Testing (UAT) 

UAT (User Acceptance Testing) :

Testing carried out by the end user on the delivered product to make sure 
whether it is ready for live production or not .

Two stages :

1. Alpha Testing 

It is a first level of Acceptance testing carried out at company premises

2. Beta Testing 

It is a last level of Acceptance testing carried out at customer/client premises

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functional System Testing Types:

1) Smoke Testing 
2) Formal Testing 
3) ReTesting
4) Regression Testing 
5) Priority based testing 
6) Sanity Testing 
7) End-to-End 
8) Ahdoc TEsting 

Special Functional System Testing :

1)Benchmark Testing 
2) Exploratory Testing 
3) Monkey Testing or Gorilla Testing 

Non-Functional System Testing Types:

1) UI TEsting or GUI Testing 
2) Usability Testing or User Friendliness 
3) Performance Testing 

Responsiveness
Stability

i) reposnse time
ii) processing time
iii) concurrent user volume 

Load Testing :

-> Stress Testing 
-> Soak Testing
-> Spike Testing
-> Volume TEsting 

4) Globalization or Internationalization or I18N Testing 

5)Localization or L10N testing 

6)Compatability 

7)Recovery Testing 

8)Installation Testing 

9)UnInstallation Testing 


Module 2:

Software Testing Project 


STLC 


-Test Planning 

Test Strategy : a high level documents which gives information about how testing activities 
carried out for project.

Test Plan : a detailed document which gives information about how testing activities 
carried out for project.

Test plan template : 

1. Project Overview
2. Document references 
3. Scope of testing 
	3.1 In scope
	3.2 out scope
4. Test Strategy
5. Test Environment
6. Test Deliverables 
7. staffing plan 
8. Risk planning and mitigation 
9. Work schedules
10. Approvals

Test Case :

A step by step procedure which includes the pre-conditions , input data, expected results 
and actual results to validate a functionality is called test case.
